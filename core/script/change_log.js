Battery Factory will require 100 energy to produce 1000 batteries, so 0.1 energy per battery. They will be charged in stacks of 10000 in the battery charger for 250 energy, so requiring 0.025 each charge, and giving back 0.024 (96%) since the Battery Power Planet will now produce 240 energy from 10000 full batteries.

Hydrology will unlock and increase water buildings production by 12%.<br>* Added new building Hunting Spot that produces foods on forest planets.<br>* Quris Art of War will now be unlocked by Antaris instead of Jabir.<br>* Antaris will have x2 bonus on T-Ammunition production. <br>* Quris Art of War will now unlock T-Ammunition assembler. 1 T-Ammunition will require 3 U-ammunition, 50 technetium and 100K steel to be produced. <br>* The bonus given by t-ammunition is 60*log2(1+T-ammunition/20M). This means it will give x1.5 the bonus of u-ammunition and will decay more slowly. <br>* Added a new empire stat: Influence. Influence is gained by conquering and possessing planets. The possesion of each planet will increase your base influence.<br>* Influence will give you a chance (up to 30%) to capture 10% of the enemy ships, given that your influence is greater than enemy influence. The chance will be min(100*(1-enemy_influence/your_influence),30). The capture will only happen at the end of a battle and won't affect cluster that have less than 10 ships. If you destroy the whole enemy fleet at the end of the battle, you won't capture anything.<br>* Influence will also earn you an income of Market Coins equal to your influence per second.<br>* Lone Nassaus will now have x5 titanium multiplier.<br>* New Babilo will now have x5 nanotubes multiplier.<br>* Added the Lava Mine. It will extract titanium (where available). It will be unlocked by Vulcanology and boosted by both Vulcanology and Geology.<br>* Added a new building: Trade Hub, unlocked by Interstellar Travel 5. The Trade Hub will unlock the Market Interface, that will let you sell and buy resources on the Galactic Market. You will control the market if you conquer New Babilo (as for now, it means that you will collect 3% of the price of goods sold by other civilization as fees). To receive and send resources from a planet, you need at least one Trade Hub. Building more of them, will result in discounts on the price of goods. When you buy resources in the trade hub, a fleet of the Orion League will carry the resources to the planet where you ordered them. You will pay in advice. If you sell resources, you will have to deliver them. The trade hub will automatically merge fleets if there is no fleet big enough to carry all the resources. The fleet will be automatically unloaded and moved to New Babilo and once it arrives, the fleet will automatically sell the resources and will go back to the origin planet.<br>* In the market, you can buy and sell every kind of unlocked resources. Its prices will differ based on rarity of that resource. The stocked quantities of resources depends on selling rates of other civilization (not yours). Conquering a civilization (ie. The City) will throw off the market some resources, like ammunition and u-ammunition. If more civilization export the same resources, conquering some of them will only result in lower amount available. The stocked amount only grows with other civilization exports not yours. If you sell 1M iron, you won't see it in the market (this has been made to avoid easy exploits while the market concept is still in development but will likely change in the future).<br>* Added Quantum Physics research, unlocked after conquering Zhura Nova. This research will unlock Particle Accelerator which produces Antimatter from 1000 energy and 1000 hydrogen. It also unlocks the Antimatter Collider which produces 10K energy from 1 antimatter and 1000 hydrogen. These buildings can only be built on gas giants.<br>* Added Metallokopta's Science research, unlocked after conquering Tsartasis. This research will unlock a new resource: Rhodium. It will also unlock the following buildings: Rhodium Extractor (which uses 800 energy and extracts 2 rhodium and 25 titanium) and Rhodium Sand Smelter (which uses 5 rhodium and 150 sand to produce 100 silicon). The rhodium extractor will be boosted by both this research and geology. This research will also boost the normal sand smelter production. The rhodium sand smelter will only be available on desert, metallic and lava planets. <br>* Added the option to add fleet to an auto route without the need to cancel it. Select an orbiting fleet, and you will have a -Merge with Autoroute- button, below Merge Fleet button. You can only merge with autoroutes that have as either destination of origin, the planet the fleet is orbiting. The fleet will be added instantly (and automatically unloaded before merging), but its effect can be observed only after the next cycle. "});

It will let you build Wahrian Space Gate and Wahrian Time Machine.<br>* The Wahrian Space Gate will let you send a fleet in a new part of the galaxy, the Andromeda Heart. This new map will have new planet for you to conquer that can be seen by researching more Interstellar Travel. To send fleets, and their transported resources, you need to consume antimatter. 1 antimatter will let you transport 100K*sqrt(gate_number) units of weight (fleet weight+resources transported) so building more Space Gates will let you transport more weight per unit of antimatter. **You won't be able to send the fleet back until later!**.<br>* The Wahrian Time Machine will let you travel in time to the beginning of your journey. After each time travel, all your Research Points (**both what you have spent and what you have left**) will be converted in Technology Points in a 1:1 ratio. Technology Points will be used to buy researches **without having its normal cost increase**. This means after each reset, you will have the option to reshape your researches to better suit your needs (or eventually keeping them in the same way before restarting). Building more Time Machines won't have any effect.<br>* Vitha will now also need 50000 iron to be built, and will require 80K of steel instead of 100k. In this way, when new players colonize the planet, they will have all the three basic resources to start building something before supplies arrive.<br>* Added Metallokopta's Biology research, unlocked after conquering Eeko Sung. This research will unlock a new resource: Osmium. It will also unlock the following buildings: Osmium Extractor (uses 1200 energy and 10 sulfur to extract 1 osmium) and the Metallokopta Clonator (which produces Re-engineered metallokoptas (MK embryos) from osmium, robots and silicon). These two buildings can only be constructed on Ice and Metallic planets (the metallokopta clonator can also be built on desert planets). This research will also unlock the production of Re-engineered Servant ship in shipyard level 15, which will require MK-embryos to be built.<br>* Eeko Sung will have x2 production of MK embryos.<br>* Metal Collector will now be unlocked at level 4 of geology.<br>* Forest planets renamed to Terrestrial planets<br>* Moved the research shortcut icon in the top menu<br>* Plus Caerul will now give x2 production bonus to antimatter.<br>* Removed technetium production bonus from New Babilo.<br>* Added total reseearch+technology points in the leader board.<br>* Reduced Kitrion silicon multiplier to 7.5.<br>* T-Ammunition will be now correctly consumed after each battle, and the Quris Empire will only export 2 t-ammunition per second.

Population will grow autonomously until a sustainable population limit is reached. This limit is calculated as (1+populationGrowth*10)*foodMultiplier*radius. After this limit, population will require food to grow. If food stocks reach 0, population will start to die until the point where either the food production is enough to sustain the population or the population drops below the sustainable level. You will see a yellow production next to food that will quantify this need. When population reaches 0, it won't grow anymore unless transported from other planets. Population will grow with a (approximate) *yearly rate* specified in the planet statistics. Some planets are not able to grow population (population growth 0%) unless transported. The population will not grow undefinitely, but will stop until an habitable space limit is reached. Habitable space is increased by particular buildings up to radius*radius*400 (so promision can have a maximum of 18B+ population).

This is done to make sure you will have enough population to sustain the next patches where population will be needed to make ships**.<br>* Cryogenics 2 will now unlock Cryocell Facility, Cryopreserver and Cryowarmer.
